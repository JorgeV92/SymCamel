# Dijkstra's algorithm 

We are instrested in solving the *single-source shortest-paths problem* in a given $G = (V, E)$ on a wieghted **directed-graph**, with the following constraint that the weights to be *nonnegative* on every edge. 
$$ w(u, v) \geq 0 \qquad \text{for each edge } (u, v) \in E$$
